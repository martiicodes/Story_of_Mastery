1. Define your goals
<br>2. Enjoy the process 
           </p>

            <p>
You'll get a bonus step at the finish line! It's the master key to success. It unites step 1 and step 2. This step will surprise you!
            </p>

            <h2>
1. Define Your Goals... and Win like an Elon Musk
            </h2>

            <p>
Do you feel like a failure? Living meaningless life?
            </p>

            <p>
We can't live without goals. Every action is a result of goals, conscious or unconscious.  
You can't get what you want if you don't aim at it.
            </p>

            <p>
Without goals, we're lost and anxious, overwhelmed with an infinite number of possibilities. Without an attractive future to look forward to, life is a nightmare. 
Without goals, people lose a big source of happiness.
            </p>

            <p>
We feel good when we progress toward goals — our own goals, things we truly want.
<br>Goals give us structure. Structure brings order. With order, we feel peace.
<br>Clarify your goals. Your target should be crystal clear in your mind.
            </p>

            <p>
Do you want to own the world or wander around, lost and unfulfilled?
            </p>

            <h2>
2. Enjoy the Process... and Don't Be Ashamed of Your Level of Success
            </h2>

            <p>
Are you stressed out? Do you feel trapped and miserable? Are you experiencing burnout?
            </p>

            <p>
<strong>Danger!</strong>You forgot why you started in the first place. You're hyper-focused on the results, so you forgot to play. All joy is gone. Without joy, you crumble.
            </p>

            <p>
Train yourself to enjoy the process. Every minute, you can be better at what you do. 
<br>Progress and improve, but don't forget to enjoy the game. 
<br>You're truly happy when you play. This is the flow state.
            </p>

            <h2>
Bonus Step
            </h2>

            <p>
Now, how do you unite step 1 and step 2 for maximum success?
            </p>

            <p>
Exclusively goal-oriented people are miserable. They're never happy, always hungry, and unable to enjoy the fruits of their hard work.
            </p>

            <p>
Exclusively process-oriented people are lost in the maze of infinite possibilities. Life without structure and order. 
<br>They try to live in the present moment to cancel suffering. Suffering comes partly from our future. 
<br>The future is a burden. Goals live in the future.
            </p>

            <p>
You need step 1 and step 2: to define your goal AND to enjoy the process, at the same time. 
<br>This may sound paradoxical to you.
            </p>

            <p>
Goals define the Game. The Game is a framework for life. It has rules, players, obstructions, and challenges. 
<br>Without goals, we have no reason to wake up in the morning.
            </p>

            <p>
Enjoying the process emerges when we enter the Game — when the goal is defined. 
<br>I guess you want to reach your goal fast. The best way to do that is to enjoy the process.
            </p>

            <p>
Step 1 and step 2 feed each other. Together, they form a powerful success loop.
            </p>

            <p>
This bonus step unites step 1 and step 2. Be focused on your goals and enjoy the process at the same time. 
<br>The bonus step requires you to accept ambiguity. Be obsessed with your goals and results. 
<br>At the same time, enjoy the process and don't worry about the results.
            </p>
