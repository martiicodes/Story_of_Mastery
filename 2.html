            <p>
Two exceptionally unremarkable days ago, I wrote dull, semi-useful, mildly original text about productivity. <br> It vas fine. One more text in the sea of copy-paste content creators. 
            </p>

            <p>
Maybe helpful for some. Probably not so for serious seeker. Anyway, it was far from masterful. So, I opted to infuse a bit of flair.               
            </p>

            <p>
My reinvigorated objective: 
            <br>
- Create Frankenstein (isn't that what all creative people do?) and re-assemble flat first draft.
- Implant design take in it. Degree of depth. Declivity.
            </p>

            <p>
WARNING: What you are about to uncover will challenge everything you know about achieving success. The secrets that follow are not for the faint of heart. I'm dead serious.
            </p>

            <p>
So, dear, brace yourself for a journey into deep and dark immensity of design. Be prepared, this could disrupt your perspective on work and creativity.
            </p>

            <p>
"Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works." 
<br> — Steve Jobs
            </p>

            <p>
This isn’t just another guide to productivity. It’s an unique creative blueprint. The strategies you’re about to discover will shatter prevailing assumptions... and only if you want... propel you toward unparalleled success!
            </p>

            <p>
Are you ready for a glorious boom?

1. Align with Life Purpose: Ignite Your Work with Meaning
            </h2>

            <p>
"Life is never made unbearable by circumstances, but only by lack of meaning and purpose."*
<br> — Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor E. Frankl
            </p>

            <p>
Having a higher purpose gives your work meaning and keeps you engaged, especially during inevitable challenging times. Finding your <strong>WHY</strong> is crucial. Your "why" is engine that drives you. Reflect on what truly matters to you. What's your impact on the planet Earth? Perhaps, on Mars? 
            </p>

            <p>
Once you identify your <strong> why </strong>, it becomes your compass. Simon Sinek's book <strong> Start with Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action </strong> is a great launching pad!
            </p>
            
            <p>
How to Do It with Design:
            </p>

            <p>
- Visual Identity: or Visual Brand DNA. Ignite your potential. Use classic design techniques to express your values and mission. This unites people. They're inspired by your vision. All visionaries do this!
            </p>

            <p>       
Good design is consistent design.  
            </p>

            <p>
Massimo Vignelli was master of timeless, minimalist design. He proved that simplicity and clarity are powerful. Across all disciplines.
            </p>

            <p>
He said that "Consistency in design translates to reliability and trust in the brand."
            </p>

            <p>
<strong> Consistency </strong> is the key for a brand's development!.
The key for a brand's prestige is <strong> positioning </strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
Now, let me mention a great branding book. Our company uses this book's insights in our  projects all the time. This vault of game-changing ideas is <strong> Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind </strong>. Written by Al Ries and Jack Trout. 
            </p>

            <p>
Get an unfair advantage with golden ideas from the book:
            </p>

            <p>
"Effective positioning requires a clear and consistent message that reinforces the brand’s unique identity."
<br> "The best way to succeed in marketing is to be the first in the minds of consumers."
<br> "The idea of positioning is to differentiate your brand in a way that stands out and resonates."
            </p>

            <p>
On top of that: Pay close attention to this gems:
            </p>

            <p>
"To win the battle for the mind, you must focus on one key idea that sets your brand apart."
"Positioning is a way to create a mental image of a brand that influences consumer behavior."
            </p>

            <p>
- Visual Tale: Use eye-catching graphics. Tell the story. What's your mission? Values? 
            </p>

            <p>
This is your visual saga and you're the creator. How fun is that?
            </p>

            <p>
Keep in mind that every art and design choice has a reason. Example: black implies sophistication and authority. It's used in luxury and high-end products.
            </p>

            <p>
We tell stories all the time. Through our clothes, looks and actions. We're already multimedia storytelling experts. Want proof: our carefully curated social media profiles.
            </p>

            <p>
What if we leverage this power? Consciously harness it?
            </p>

            <p>
We can become architects of our lives.
            </p>

            <p>
In famous animation book **The Illusion of Life: Disney Animation**, published in 1981, Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston write: “The art of animation is to make every design choice, from color to movement, an integral part of the story being told.”
            </p>

2. Turn Work into Play: Enjoy Every Moment of Your Relentless Hustle
            </h2>

“Rapture comes not from the possession of things, but from the beauty of moments transcended.”
<br> – Gustave Flaubert
            </p>

            <p>
Enjoy the process because enjoyment leads to more productivity.
            </p>

            <p>
How to Do It with Design:
            </p>

            <p>
- Workspace Design: Create a fun and inspiring productivity playground with intentionally selected colors and visually pleasing decor. Anthropocentric spatial configuration. 
            </p>

            <p>
Customize your work oasis with special personal embellishments - favorite quotes, photos, artwork, etc. Create an environment that brings you joy and motivation.
            </p>

            <p>
"The role of design is to create spaces that make people feel good and work better."
<br>– Patricia Urquiola
            </p>

            <p>
              - Toys: Use lovely and intuitive tools to make tasks irresistible.
            </p>

            <p>
Obsidian is like that. People call it second brain. It's just delightful. Check it out.
            </p>

            <p>
Success toys can also be analog. Spread them around like a kid. Stimulate your mind. 
Outer space translates to inner mental space. 
            </p>

            <p>
- Flow: Declutter your environment. Kill obstructions. Design creative habitat with simple, defined areas for different tasks. Interior design can help you be in the zone. 
            </p>

            <p>
There's only you and your goal. This single-mindedness is where flow state emerges. 
            </p>

            <p>
What kind of environment is this?
            </p>

            <p>
Design your area for different goals. Use symbolic clues to stay set on targets.
            </p>

            <p>
Picture yourself have so much fun. Work and play are one.
Are you ready to redefine your limits? Become limitless? I say, you can

3. Create Unstoppable Momentum: Keep Pushing Forward
            </h2>

            <p>
"It ain't about how hard you hit! It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward!"
            </p>

            <p>
Rocky is yelling in my ear and I keep running... Buzzing with spirit of victory I can't stop...
            </p>

            <p>
Momentum helps you keep progressing. As you move toward your goal, your steps become larger and larger... Steps were big. Now, they're small and easy.
            </p>

            <p>
Just as a tiny disturbance can trigger an avalanche, small achievements and modest actions can act as catalysts for epic triumphs! Each small win builds confidence and momentum, which lead to even bigger success.
            </p>

            <p>
Once momentum is established, it can build fast. A series of small triumphs creates a cumulative effect that can lead to bigger wins. This momentum, once triggered, can lead to rapid progress and success.
            </p>

            <p>
How to Do It with Design:
            </p>

            <p>
- Track Progress: Use visually intuitive project management tools to track progress.
            </p>

            <p>
Regularly update visual charts and graphs to reflect your achievements and maintain motivation.
            </p>

            <p>
Use mixmedia.
            </p>

            <p>
Once you start making progress, success avalanche gets more power. The more effort and energy you invest, the more "mass" you add to your momentum. As with physics, greater momentum means that your progress becomes self-sustaining and can lead to greater achievements.
            </p>

            <p>
In our case that "mass" is a good design. Design helps you become almost unstoppable.
            </p>

            <p>
Say goodbye to the heard mentality. Revolutionize the way you see your progress. Learn to

4. Reframe Challenges: Unlock the Power of a Growth Mindset
            </h2>

            <p>
As you read this, you may begin to see fresh new possibilities. Maybe new doors of opportunities open up to you and now you feel refreshed with new pleasant feelings. But, hey! Wait until you hear this!
            </p>

            <p>
Typically, people experience the world through fixed mindset. They think they aren't able to become better. That their circumstances are somehow fixed.
            </p>

            <p>
In contrast to that, growth mindset helps you see challenges as opportunities to learn and improve. Challenges help you grow! A growth mindset is the belief that you can improve and get better through effort and learning.
            </p>

            <p>
How to Do It with Design:
            </p>

            <p>
- Visual Problem-Solving: Break down challenges into micro-components. Visualize them. Make them more manageable. What you can see you can measure. What you can measure you can manage.
            </p>

            <p>
Find optimal point of challenge.
            </p>

            <p>
- Images of Growth: Imagine bettering yourself. Find or create representations of your potential.
            </p>

            <p>
Make image of your ideal future self. And strive to be closer to it daily. Attractive is not good enough. It should energize you, moves yo. Idea of it, becoming a reality, makes you extatic!
            </p>

            <p>
Now, hold on tight... What you’re venturing into will not only shatter your daily routine to pieces. It'll also redefine your entire approach to game of success. The life-changing strategies and secrets are knocking on your doors. They're equipped to launch you into the fuzzy realms of ever-lasting opulence. Your ideal life. And almost impossible to attain... They're ideals, after all.

Good habits are the foundation of long-term success. I'm sure Bill Gates, Dalai Lama and Christiano Ronaldo have excellent habits.

How to Do It with Design:
            </p>

            <p>
- Habit Trackers: Use beautifully designed habit trackers to monitor your daily routines. Distinctively designed user interface will make it feel more pleasant. Like you're a playing fun video game.
            </p>

            <p>
- Visual Reminders: Or triggers. Place strong visual reminders around your environment, so you focus on your habits. Environments shape us and we can shape them too. Design your own habit triggers. Design space for success!

            </p>

            <p>
- Achievement Graphics: Apply visually engaging images to celebrate milestones and achievements. All of this you can do digitally. In a way, you're already utilizing this on your social media profiles. Reopen your Linkedin portal! This is a mine of untapped gold for us aesthetic engineers!
            </p>

            <p>
- Uniform: Did you saw how sport competitors wear peculiar apparel? Did you notice how superheroes display remarkable, one-of-a-kind fashion choices. Underwear on top of everything else? Strong colors? All of that makes the process more unique. Like you're preparing to do something special. Just like you're in a game!
            </p>

I don't think its a coincidence that Steve Jobs whore black turtleneck, blue jeans and New Ballance sneakers, every day.
